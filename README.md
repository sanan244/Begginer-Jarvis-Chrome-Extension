# Beginer-Jarvis-Chrome-Extension
##This is a beginner project and my first attempt at making a chrome extension. 
1.Currently the extension changes the background of any available visited url. 
2.When the extension icon is clicked the user can click a button to wake up Jarvis and he will tell the user what website they are currently at.
